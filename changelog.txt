1.1
-added SafeSend (right-click the tabs at the bottom to expand them
-added third column (enabled through Settings menu, called Josh's notes field)
-started using proper ini file handling
-moved option to enable Web Bold scraping and themes to the Settings menu
-known bug: if you make a change in the settings menu without going to the safesend tab, it unchecks everything.  Fixed in dev version, but that version is currently riddled with bugs.  For now just go to the safesend tab the first time you enter the settings menu.  You don't have to go back there until you close smpninja)
-Yes, it's huge now, and best run in its own folder.  That's because it's got a built in web browser for SafeSend
